Basic Requirements

Planning documentation

- Figma which details the layout of my website as well as the interactive elements

- MVP features are the buttons, inputs, and checkboxes that all do different things. I have 3 buttons that reveal 3 different trails that 
I have selected. These trails are pulled from my backend as the buttons make a request to view them. The trails all have criteria that they
are graded on. This criteria consists of the trail name, location, difficulty and rating out of 5. The Front End has custom styling and is 
interactive. 

Needs to have an interactive front end (inputs, buttons, etc.)

- 3 buttons are explained above. There is a part of my website that allows Users to submit their own trails with the same criteria that I 
gave my own trails. The trail name and location are text inputs, the difficulty is a drop down box with the values of easy, medium and
hard. The rating is a checkbox that is out of 5.

- I also have a button that takes you to a different page where the user can see the trails they have submitted, as well as the other trails
that others have submitted. There is a button on that page that will get all of the traisl from the backend and display them. Finally, 
there is a button that will take you back to the homepage. 

Should have at least 3 main features
